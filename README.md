# Forth Computing

I've always been the fan of the Jupiter Ace 8-bit micro from the 1980s, ever since I moved to it from my ZX81. Sure it was quirky, and the case and keyboard were rubbish, but it was fun to write games for. Recently a good re-make of the Ace became available and rekindled some ideas and projects.
